<h2 id="cf">Computer Fundamentals</h2>
<p>Computer fundamentals tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of Bootstrap. Our Computer fundamentals is designed for beginners and professionals.</p>
<p>Computer is an electronic device i.e. used to work with information or compute. It is derived from the Latin word "computare" which means to calculate.</p>
<p>Our Computer fundamentals tutorial includes all topics of Computer fundamentals such as input devices, output devices, memory, CPU, motherboard, computer network, virus, software, hardware etc.</p>
<h2 id="wc">What is Computer</h2>
<p>A computer is a programmable electronic device that accepts raw data as input and processes it with a set of instructions (a program) to produce the result as output. It renders output just after performing mathematical and logical operations and can save the output for future use. It can process numerical as well as non-numerical calculations. The term "computer" is derived from the Latin word "computare" which means to calculate.</p>
<p>A computer is designed to execute applications and provides a variety of solutions through integrated hardware and software components. It works with the help of programs and represents the decimal numbers through a string of binary digits. It also has a memory that stores the data, programs, and result of processing. The components of a computer such as machinery that includes wires, transistors, circuits, hard disk are called hardware. Whereas, the programs and data are called software.</p>
<p>It is believed that the Analytical Engine was the first computer which was invented by Charles Babbage in 1837. It used punch cards as read-only memory. Charles Babbage is also known as the father of the computer.</p>
<h2 id="ipd">Input Devices</h2>
Input device enables the user to send data, information, or control signals to a computer. The Central Processing Unit (CPU) of a computer receives the input and processes it to produce the output.
<h3 id="kb">Keyboard</h3>
The keyboard is a basic input device that is used to enter data into a computer or any other electronic device by pressing keys. It has different sets of keys for letters, numbers, characters, and functions. Keyboards are connected to a computer through USB or a Bluetooth device for wireless communication.
<h4>Types of keyboards:</h4>
<p>There can be different types of keyboards based on the region and language used. Some of the common types of keyboards are as follows:</p>
<h3>i) QWERTY Keyboard:</h3>
<img src="keyboard.jpg" />
<p>It is the most commonly used keyboard with computers in modern times. It is named after the first six letters of the top row of buttons and is even popular in countries that do not use Latin-based alphabet. It is so popular that some people think that it is the only type of keyboard to use with computers as an input device.</p>
<h3>ii) AZERTY Keyboard:</h3>
<img src="azerty-keyboard.png" />
<p>It is considered the standard French keyboard. It is developed in France as an alternative layout to the QWERTY layout and is mainly used in France and other European countries. Some countries have manufactured their own versions of AZERTY.</p>
<p>Its name is derived from the first six letters that appear on the top left row of the keyboard. The Q and W keys in AZERTY keyboard are interchanged with A and Z keys in QWERTY keyboard. Furthermore, in AZERTY keyboard M key is located to the left of the L key.</p>
<p>AZERTY keyboard differs from QWERTY keyboard not only in the placement of letters but also in many other ways, e.g., it gives emphasis on accents, which is required for writing European languages like French.</p>
<h3>iii) DVORAK Keyboard:</h3>
<img src="dvorak-keyboard.png" />
<p>This type of keyboard layout was developed to increase the typing speed by reducing the finger movement while typing. The most frequently used letters are kept in a home row to improve typing.</p>
<h3 id="ms">Mouse</h3>
The mouse is a hand-held input device which is used to move cursor or pointer across the screen. It is designed to be used on a flat surface and generally has left and right button and a scroll wheel between them. Laptop computers come with a touchpad that works as a mouse. It lets you control the movement of cursor or pointer by moving your finger over the touchpad. Some mouse comes with integrated features such as extra buttons to perform different buttons.
<p>The mouse was invented by Douglas C. Engelbart in 1963. Early mouse had a roller ball integrated as a movement sensor underneath the device. Modern mouse devices come with optical technology that controls cursor movements by a visible or invisible light beam. A mouse is connected to a computer through different ports depending on the type of computer and type of a mouse.</p>
<h4>Common types of mouse:</h4>
<h3>i) Trackball Mouse:</h3>
<img src="trackball-mouse.png" />
<p>It is a stationary input device that has ball mechanism to move the pointer or cursor on the screen. The ball is half inserted in the device and can be easily rolled with finger, thumb or the palm to move the pointer on the screen. The device has sensor to detect the rotation of ball. It remains stationary; you don't need to move it on the operating surface. So, it is an ideal device if you have limited desk space as you don't need to move it like a mouse.</p>
<h3>Mechanical Mouse:</h3>
<img src="mechanical-mouse.png" />
<p>It has a system of a ball and several rollers to track its movement. It is a corded type of mouse. A mechanical mouse can be used for high performance. The drawback is that they tend to get dust into the mechanics and thus require regular cleaning.</p>
<h3>iii) Optical Mouse:</h3>
<img src="optical-mouse.png" />
<p>An optical mouse uses optical electronics to track its movement. It is more reliable than a mechanical mouse and also requires less maintenance. However, its performance is affected by the surface on which it is operated. Plain non-glossy mouse mat should be used for best results. The rough surface may cause problems for the optical recognition system, and the glossy surface may reflect the light wrongly and thus may cause tracking issues.</p>
<h3 id="sc"Scanner</h3>
The scanner uses the pictures and pages of text as input. It scans the picture or a document. The scanned picture or document then converted into a digital format or file and is displayed on the screen as an output. It uses optical character recognition techniques to convert images into digital ones. Some of the common types of scanners are as follows:
<h4>Types of Scanner:</h4>
<h3>i) Flatbed Scanner:</h3>
<img src="scanner.jpg" />
<p>It has a glass pane and a moving optical CIS or CCD array. The light illuminates the pane, and then the image is placed on the glass pane. The light moves across the glass pane and scans the document and thus produces its digital copy. You will need a transparency adapter while scanning transparent slides.</p>
<h3>ii) Handheld Scanner:</h3>
<img src="handheld-scanner.png" />
<p>It is a small manual scanning device which is held by hand and is rolled over a flat image that is to be scanned. The drawback in using this device is that the hand should be steady while scanning; otherwise, it may distort the image. One of the commonly used handheld scanners is the barcode scanner which you would have seen in shopping stores.</p>
<h3>iii) Sheetfed Scanner:</h3>
<img src="sheetfed-scanner.png" />
<p>In this scanner, the document is inserted into the slot provided in the scanner. The main components of this scanner include the sheet-feeder, scanning module, and calibration sheet. The light does not move in this scanner. Instead, the document moves through the scanner. It is suitable for scanning single page documents, not for thick objects like books, magazines, etc.</p>
<h2 id="jsk">Joystick</h2>
<img src="joystick.jpg" />
<p>A joystick is also a pointing input device like a mouse. It is made up of a stick with a spherical base. The base is fitted in a socket that allows free movement of the stick. The movement of stick controls the cursor or pointer on the screen.</p>
<p>The frist joystick was invented by C. B. Mirick at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory. A joystick can be of different types such as displacement joysticks, finger-operated joysticks, hand operated, isometric joystick, and more. In joystick, the cursor keeps moving in the direction of the joystick unless it is upright, whereas, in mouse, the cursor moves only when the mouse moves.</p>
<h2 id="opd">Output Devices</h2>
<p>The output device displays the result of the processing of raw data that is entered in the computer through an input device. There are a number of output devices that display output in different ways such as text, images, hard copies, and audio or video.</p>
<h4>Some of the popular output devices are:</h4>
<h3 id="mntr">1.Monitor</h3>
<h3 id="crt">CRT Monitor</h3>
<img src="crt-monitor.jpg" />
<p>CRT monitors are based on the cathode ray tubes. They are like vacuum tubes which produce images in the form of video signals. Cathode rays tube produces a beam of electrons through electron guns that strike on the inner phosphorescent surface of the screen to produce images on the screen. The monitor contains millions of phosphorus dots of red, green and blue color. These dots start to glow when struck by electron beams and this phenomenon is called cathodoluminescence.</p>
<p>The main components of a CRT monitor include the electron gun assembly, deflection plate assembly, fluorescent screen, glass envelope, and base.The front (outer surface) of the screen onto which images are produced is called the face plate. It is made up of fiber optics.</p>
<p>There are three electron beams that strike the screen: red, green, and blue. So, the colors which you see on the screen are the blends of red, blue and green lights.The magnetic field guides the beams of electrons. Although LCDs have replaced the CRT monitors, the CRT monitors are still used by graphics professionals because of their color quality.</p>
<h3 id="lcd">ii) LCD Monitor</h3>
<img src="lcd-monitor.jpg" />
<p>The LCD monitor is a flat panel screen that is compact and light-weight as compared to CRT monitors. It is based on liquid crystal display technology which is used in the screens of laptops, tablets, smart phones, etc. An LCD screen comprises two layers of polarized glass with a liquid crystal solution between them. When the light passes through the first layer, an electric current aligns the liquids crystals. The aligned liquid crystals allow a varying level of light to pass through the second layer to create images on the screen.</p>
<p>The LCD screen has a matrix of pixels that display the image on the screen.Old LCDs had passive-matrix screens in which individual pixels are controlled by sending a charge. A few electrical charges could be sent each second that made screens appear blurry when the images moved quickly on the screen.</p>
<p>Modern LCDs use active-matrix technology and contain thin film transistors (TFTs) with capacitors. This technology allows pixels to retain their charge. So, they don?t make screen blurry when images move fast on the screen as well as are more efficient than passive-matrix displays.</p>
<h3 id="led">iii) LED monitor</h3>
<img src="led-monitor.jpg" />
<p>The LED monitor is an improved version of an LCD monitor. It also has a flat panel display and uses liquid crystal display technology like the LCD monitors. The difference between them lies in the source of light to backlight the display. The LED monitor has many LED panels, and each panel has several LEDsto backlight the display, whereas the LCD monitors use cold cathode fluorescent light to backlight the display.Modern electronic devices such as mobile phones, LED TVs, laptop and computer screens, etc., use a LED display as it not only produces more brilliance and greater light intensity but also consumes less power.</p>
<h3 id="plm">iv) Plasma Monitor</h3>
<img src="plasma-monitor.jpg" />
<p>The plasma monitor is also a flat panel display that is based on plasma display technology. It has small tiny cells between two glass panels. These cells contain mixtures of noble gases and a small amount of mercury. When voltage is applied, the gas in the cells turns into a plasma and emits ultraviolet light that creates images on the screen, i.e., the screen is illuminated by a tiny bit of plasma, a charged gas. Plasma displays are brighter than liquid crystal displays (LCD) and also offer a wide viewing angle than an LCD.</p>
<p><Plasma monitors provide high resolutions of up to 1920 X 1080, excellent contrast ratios, wide viewing angle, a high refresh rate and more. Thus, they offer a unique viewing experience while watching action movies, sports games, and more./p>
