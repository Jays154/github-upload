<body><h1>Primary Memory:</h1>
<p>Primary storage (also known as main memory) is the component of the computer that holds data, programs and instructions that are currently in use.</p>
<p>Primary storage is located on the motherboard. As a result, data can be read from and written to primary storage extremely quickly. This gives the processor fast access to the data and instructions that the primary storage holds.</p>
<p>There are four types of primary storage:</p>
.read only memory (ROM)<br/>
.random access memory (RAM)<br/>
.flash memory<br/>
.cache memory
<p>The two main types of primary storage are ROM, which is non-volatile, and RAM, which is volatile. Non-volatile memory keeps its contents even when the computer is switched off. Volatile memory loses its contents when power is lost.</p>
<p>Primary storage is comparatively limited in size, especially when compared with secondary storage. In a modern personal computer, primary storage is often around 4 GB in size.</p>
