<body><p>There are many outputs created by a computer system. These include printed documents, on-screen data and sound. An output device allows data to be transmitted by the computer in a human-friendly form, for example, sound being played through a speaker.</p>
<h3>1.Monitor -</h3> The main output device of a computer. It forms images by converting electrical energy into light in the form of tiny dots on the screen called pixels. The sharpness of the image depends upon the number of pixels.<br/>
<h3>2.Printer -</h3> Used to print information on paper. Commonly uses either lasers or inkjets to precisely place ink onto the page to recreate text and high-quality images.<br/>
<h3>3.Speaker -</h3> Converts digital signals into audible sound waves.<br/>
